# Static functionality tests

These tests used to be part of Scala DOM Builder, which Laminar depended upon until v0.8. Now that Laminar is taking care of this functionality itself, we moved the tests for it here.

Don't add any tests that touch reactive variables here. This is for basic stuff like attribute and child setters.
