// #TODO[Naming] This feels more like InserterState?

/**
 * InsertContext represents the state of the DOM inside an inserter block like `child <-- ...`,
 * `children <-- ...`, `child.text <-- ...`, etc. The data stored in this context is used
 * by Laminar to efficiently update the DOM, to detect (and recover from) external changes
 * to the DOM, and for other related tasks.
 *
 * InsertContext is a mutable data structure that is created once for each inserter, and the
 * inserter updates it as it processes new data. However, in case of `onMountInsert`, only
 * one context is created, and is then reused for all inserters created inside
 * `onMountInsert`. This allows for intuitive preservation of DOM state if the element is
 * unmounted and mounted again (for example, `onMountInsert(child <-- stream)` will
 * keep the last emitted child in the DOM even if the element is unmounted and re-mounted).
 *
 * #Note: The params that describe `extraNodes` below can get out of sync with the real DOM.
 *
 * This can happen if an child element is removed from the DOM â€“ either externally, or more
 * likely because it was moved from this inserter into another one, and the addition to the
 * other inserter was processed before the removal from this inserter is processed (the
 * order of these operations depends on the propagation order of the observables feeding
 * these two inserters). The Inserter code must account for this and not fail in such cases,
 * and must correct the values accordingly on the next observable update.
 *
 * #Note: The params that describe `extraNodes` below must be kept consistent manually (#Perf)
 *
 *                              Inserter "steals" an element from this one just before the
 *                              observable source of this inserter provides a new list of
 *                              children (with the stolen element removed from the list).
 *
 * @param sentinelNode        - A special invisible comment node that tells Laminar where to
 *                              insert the dynamic children, and where to expect previously
 *                              inserted dynamic children.
 * @param strictMode          - If true, Laminar guarantees that it will keep a dedicated
 *                              sentinel node instead of using the extra node (content node)
 *                              for that purpose. This is needed in order to allow users to
 *                              move an element from one inserter to another, or to externally
 *                              remove some of the elements previously added by an inserter.
 *                              child.text does not need any of that, so for performance it
 *                              does not use strict mode, it replaces the sentinel comment
 *                              node with the subsequent text nodes. Inserters should be able
 *                              to safely switch to their preferred mode when receiving
 *                              context left by the previous inserter in onMountBind.
 * @param extraNodeCount      - Number of child nodes in addition to the sentinel node.
 *                              Warning: can get out of sync with the real DOM!
 * @param extraNodesMap       - Map of child nodes in addition to the sentinel node,
 *                              for more efficient search
 *                              Warning: can get out of sync with the real DOM!
