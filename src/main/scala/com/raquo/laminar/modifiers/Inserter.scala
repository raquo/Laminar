// @TODO[API] Inserter really wants to extend Binder. And yet.

/** Inserter is a modifier that lets you insert child node(s) on mount.
  * When used with onMountInsert, it "immediately" reserves an insertion
  * spot and then on every mount it inserts the node(s) into the same spot.
  *
  * Note: As a Modifier this is not idemponent, but overall
  * it behaves as you would expect. See docs for more details.
  *
  * Note: If you DO provide initialContext, its parentNode MUST always
  * be the same `element` that you apply this Modifier to.
