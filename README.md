Laminar is a small library that lets you build web application interfaces, keeping UI state in sync with the underlying application state. Its simple yet expressive patterns build on a rock solid foundation of [Airstream](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream) observables and the [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) platform.
