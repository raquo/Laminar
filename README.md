## Introduction

Laminar's basic building block are elements:

```scala
val streamOfNames: XStream[String] = ???
val helloDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = div("Hello, ", child <-- streamOfNames)
```

`helloDiv` is a div element that contains the text "Hello, `<Name>`", where `<Name>` is the latest value emitted by `streamOfNames`. As you see, `helloDiv` is **self-contained**. It depends on a stream, but is not a stream itself. It manages itself, abstracting away the complexity of its innards from the rest of your program.

Laminar does not use virtual DOM, and a Laminar element is not a virtual DOM node, instead it is linked one-to-one to an actual JS DOM element. That means that if you want something about that element to be dynamic, you should define it inside the element like we did with `child <-- streamOfNames` above. This allows for precision DOM updates instead of inefficient virtual DOM diffing.

With that out of the way, here is what a pretty simple Laminar "Component" could look like:

```scala
def Hello(streamOfNames: XStream[String], streamOfColors: XStream[String]): ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = {
  div(
    fontSize := "20px",
    color <-- streamOfColors, // dynamic CSS property
    "Hello, ",
    child <-- streamOfNames // dynamic child (text node in this case)
  )
}
```

Almost the same as what we had before, but now with dynamic color and a bit of styling, and more importantly – abstracted away inside a function. Here's how you use it in your app:

```scala
val streamOfNames: XStream[String] = ???
val streamOfColors: XStream[String] = ???
 
val appDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.thml.Div] = div(
  h1("User Welcomer 9000"),
  div(
    "Please accept our greeting: ",
    Hello(streamOfNames, streamOfColors) // Inserts the div element here
  )
)
```

Easy, eh? But wait a minute, the streams are coming out of thin air! Fair enough, let's add an input text box for users to type their name into, and get the name from there:

```scala
val nameBus: EventBus[String] = new EventBus[String]
val $color: XStream[String] = nameBus.$.map { name => // $ prefix is Laminar's naming convention for "stream of"
  if (name == "Sébastien") "red" else "auto" // make Sébastien feel special 
}
 
val appDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.thml.Div] = div(
  h1("User Welcomer 9000"),
  div(
    "Please enter your name:"
    input(
      typ := "text",
      onInput().mapToThisNode.map(_.ref.value) --> nameBus // extract text entered into this input node whenever the user types in it
    )
  )
  div(
    "Please accept our greeting: ",
    Hello(nameBus.$, $color) // Inserts the div element here
  )
)
```

That's a lot to take in, so let's explain some new features we're using:

An `EventBus` is an object that can receive events from a Laminar element, and exposes a stream of those events as property `$` (`$` stands for "stream" / "stream of").

Inside the input node we're registering an event listener for the `onInput` event, and apply some transformations (that are explained in detail in the documentation below) to convert those DOM events into text values that we actually care about. Then we pass those text values into `nameBus` using `-->`.   

Color stream (`$color`) is now derived entirely out of the stream of names.
 
For extra clarity: `nameBus.$` is a stream of all values passed to `nameBus`. In our case it contains a stream of values from the input text box. Whenever the user types into the text box, this stream emits an updated name.

We could abstract away the input box to simplify our appDiv code. Here's one way to do it:

```scala
def InputBox(caption: String, textBus: WriteBus[String]): ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = {
  div(
    caption,
    input(
      typ := "text",
      onInput().mapToThisNode.map(_.ref.value) --> textBus
    )
  )
}
```

Then you just call `InputBox("Please enter your name:", nameBus)` instead of `div("Please enter your name:", input(...))` in `appDiv`.

But this is not the only way! Being a generic component, `InputBox` should probably not assume what events the consumer is interested in (`onInput`, `onKeyUp`, `onChange`?), so instead we could write a component that simply exports the elements that it creates, letting the consumer subscribe to whatever events it cares about on those elements: 

```scala
class InputBox private ( // create instances of InputBox using InputBox.apply
  val node: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div], // consumers should add this element into the tree
  val inputNode: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Input] // consumers can subscribe to events coming from this element
)
 
object InputBox {
  def apply(caption: String): InputBox = {
    val inputNode = input(typ := "text")
    val node = div(caption, inputNode)
    InputBox(node, inputNode)
  }
}
```

And this is how we would use it:

```scala
val inputBox = InputBox("Please enter your name:")
 
val $name: XStream[String] inputBox.inputNode.$event(onInput) // .$event(eventProp) gets a stream of <eventProp> events (works on any ReactiveElement)
  .map(_ => inputBox.inputNode.ref.value) // gets the current value from the input text box
   
val $color: XStream[String] = $name.map { name => // $ prefix is Laminar's naming convention for "stream of"
  if (name == "Sébastien") "red" else "black" // make Sébastien feel special 
} 
 
val appDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.thml.Div] = div(
  h1("User Welcomer 9000"),
  inputBox.node,
  div(
    "Please accept our greeting: ",
    Hello($name, $color) // Inserts the div element here
  )
)
```

It's all the same behaviour, just different composition. In this pattern the `InputBox` component exposes two important nodes: `node` that should be included into the DOM tree, and `inputNode` that it knows the consuming code will want to listen for events. This is a very good pattern for generic components.

Lastly, you should mount `appDiv` so that it actually appears in the document:

```scala
render(dom.document.querySelector("#appContainer"), appDiv)
```

Laminar has more exciting features to make building your programs a breeze. There's a lot of documentation below explaining all of Laminar's concepts in much greater detail.



## Documentation

Laminar is very simple under the hood. You can see how most of it works just by using "Go to definition" functionality of your IDE. Nevertheless, the documentation provided here will help you understand how everything ties together. Documentation sections progress from basic to advanced, so each next section usually assumes that you've read all previous sections.


### Tags & Elements

Laminar uses [Scala DOM Types](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-types) listings of typed tags, attributes, props, event props, etc. For example, this is how we know that `onClick` events produce `dom.MouseEvent` events and not `dom.KeyboardEvent`. All of these are available by importing `com.raquo.laminar.bundle._` (Note: this also imports the necessary implicits. If you don't want to import `bundle._`, make sure to import `laminar.implicits._` instead).  

`div` is a `ReactiveTag[dom.html.Div]`, it's a factory of div elements. `ReactiveTag` extends `Tag` from _Scala DOM Types_ and contains basic information needed to create such an element, such as its tag name ("div"). 

`div()` is a `ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div]` built using `TagSyntax.apply` (applied implicitly) which ultimately calls `ReactiveTag.build`. `TagSyntax` comes from [Scala DOM Builder](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-builder), a low level DOM manipulation library that lets you build trees of Scala objects (elements) that represent the actual tree of JS DOM elements.

In short, that element you created by calling `div()` is not what we call a native/real JS DOM Element, it's not an instance of `dom.Element`. It's our own `ReactiveElement` object that is _linked_ to the real JS DOM element (`dom.Element`) that it represents via its `.ref` property.

This is also not a virtual DOM. When you create a `ReactiveElement`, Laminar immediately creates the underlying `dom.Element`. That reference is immutable, so these two instances will go together for the duration of their lifetimes. In contrast, in a virtual DOM library (which Laminar is not) you typically create new instances of virtual elements when they change, and these get loosely matched to a `dom.Element` which could actually be a different element over time depending on how the updates that you're requesting and the implementation of virtual DOM's diffing algorithm.  

Read on for how to use this element we've created.


### Modifiers

The `div()` call described above creates an empty div element – no children, no attributes, nothing. Here's how to specify desired attributes:

```scala
input(typ := "checkbox", defaultChecked := true)
```

This creates an `input` element and sets two attributes on it. It's mostly obvious what it does, but how?

As we've established before, `input()` call is actually `TagSyntax[El].apply(modifiers: Modifier[El]*)`. So, we can pass Modifiers to it. A `Modifier[El]` is a simple trait that extends `El => Unit`. Conceptually, it's a function that you can apply to an element `El` to modify it in some way. In our case, `typ := "checkbox"` is a `Modifier` that sets the "type" attribute on the element given to it to "checkbox".

The `:=` method is coming from `KeySyntax`, another _Scala DOM Builder_ class that's used via an implicit conversion. It creates a setter – a `Modifier` that sets a specific key to a specific value. You can set DOM props and CSS style props the same way (e.g. `backgroundColor := "red"`)

`typ` is coming from _Scala DOM Types_ and represents the "type" attribute. You should consult _Scala DOM Types_ documentation for a list of naming differences relative to the native JS DOM API. It will also explain why the "checked" attribute is called `defaultChecked`, and why it accepts a boolean even though all HTML attributes only ever deal in strings in JS DOM (hint: Codecs).

#### Nesting and Children

```scala
val inputCaption = span("First & last name:") 
 
div(
  h1("Hello world", color := "red"),
  inputCaption,
  input(typ := "text", name := "fullName"),
  div(
    ">>",
    button("Submit"),
    "<<"
  )
)
```

This above is how you nest multiple elements. Any element is actually a Modifier that **appends** itself as a child to the element to which the modifier is applied. Modifiers are applied in the order in which they're passed to the element, so what you see in your code is what you get in the resulting DOM.  

Strings are implicitly converted to `ReactiveText` nodes which are also modifiers that append text nodes with a given text to the element in question. 

Notice that the code snippet above does not require you to HTML-escape `"&"` or `"<"`. You're just writing Scala code, you're not writing HTML (or anything that will be parsed as HTML), so don't worry about it.

#### Reusing Elements

You can't put the same element twice into the real JS DOM – instead, it will be removed from its old location and **moved** into its new location. That's just how the browser DOM works.

If you need a bunch of identical elements in the DOM, create a function that creates and returns such elements.

#### Modifiers FAQ

1. Yes, you can create custom Modifiers. You could for example define your own attributes or CSS props (consult _Scala DOM Types_) so that the `:=` method picks them up to create Modifiers. Or for completely custom logic you could create a class extending the `Modifier` trait. That way you could for example make a modifier that applies multiple other modifiers that you often use together.

2. Yes, you can add Modifiers to an element that already exists: `myModifier.apply(myElement)`. Of course, be careful for what you wish for. Your code should have some kind of concept on who owns and is responsible for which elements. If you think you need this feature, please do read about components and reactive data first.

3. No, Modifiers are not guaranteed to be idempotent. Applying the same Modifier to the same element multiple times might have different results from applying it only once. Setters like `key := value` typically _are_ idempotent. There  should be no surprises as long as you understand what the modifier does at a high level.

4. Yes, Modifiers are reusable. The same modifier can be applied to multiple nodes (with some exceptions, e.g. not if the Modifier is an element – see "Reusing Elements" section above). If you're writing your own Modifier, don't store application-specific state outside of its `apply` method to make it reusable.


### Rendering

When you create an element, it is initially detached from the DOM. That is, it has no parent element, and does not appear in the document that the user sees. Such an element is _unmounted_.

For the user to see this element we need to _mount_ it into the DOM by either adding it as a Modifier to another element that is (or at some point will become) _mounted_, or if we're dealing with the top element in our application's hierarchy, we ask Laminar to _render_ it into some container `dom.Element` that already exists on the page. Said container must not be managed by Laminar. 

```scala
val appContainer: dom.Element = dom.document.querySelector("#appContainer")
val appElement: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = div(
  h1("Hello"),
  "Current time is:",
  b("12:00") 
)
 
val root: ReactiveRoot = L.render(appContainer, appElement)
```

That's it. Laminar will find an element with id "appContainer" in the document, and append `appElement.ref` as its child. For sanity sake, the container should not have any other children, but that's not really a requirement.

To remove your whole app from the DOM, simply call `root.unmount()`. 


### Reactive Data

In the code snippet above we're mounting a completely static element – it will not change over time. This section is about creating elements that will one way or another change over time.

In a virtual DOM library like React or Snabbdom, changing an element over time is achieved by creating a new virtual element that contains the information on what the element should look like, then running a diffing algorithm on this new virtual element and the previous virtual element representing the same real JS DOM element. Said diffing algorithm will come up with a list of operations that need to be performed on the underlying JS DOM element in order to bring it to the state prescribed by the new virtual element you've created.  

Laminar does not work like that. We use reactive streams to represent elements changing over time. Let's see how this is much simpler than any virtual DOM.

Laminar uses [XStream.js](https://github.com/staltz/xstream) streams via [XStream.scala](https://github.com/raquo/XStream.scala) typed interface. It is designed specifically for Cycle.js, a use case much like Laminar', and is much simpler than typical Scala streaming libraries (no execution context / multi-threading – thanks, Javascript). To use Laminar, you will need an understanding of how typical lazy streams work, and some basic knowledge of XStream.  

Note: As a convention both in the docs and in Laminar API, we use dollar-prefixed names for streams. So `$count: XStream[Int]` would be a stream of counts. A `$url: XStream[String]` would be a stream of URLs. Notice that `url` is singular. if the stream emitted lists of urls instead, then you could call it `$urls: XStream[List[String]]` (or `$urlList`). So:

```scala
val $prettyColor: XStream[String] = ???
val myDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = div(color <-- $prettyColor, "Hello")
```

The above snippet creates a div element with the word "Hello" in it, and a dynamic `color` CSS property. Any time the `$prettyColor` stream emits an event, this element's `color` property will be updated to the emitted value. 

The method `<--` comes from `AttrReceiver` (which wraps an `Attr` with an implicit conversion) and creates an `AttrSetter`, which is a `Modifier` that subscribes to the given stream, and sets the given attribute on a given element when the stream emits a new value. This subscription will be automatically removed when the div element is discarded. More on that in the sections "Stream Memory Management" and "Element Lifecycle Events" way below. Don't worry about that for now.

What happens if `$prettyColor` didn't emit an event yet? Nothing. We don't set a default value. You could achieve that in two ways: Use an XStream.js MemoryStream (consult XStream docs)

One very important takeaway from the code snippet above is that `myDiv` did not become a stream of elements just because it depends on a stream now. Think about it: you are not creating new elements when `$prettyColor` emits an event, you are merely setting an attribute to a new value on an existing element. This is very efficient and is in stark contrast to the amount of work a virtual DOM needs to do in order to perform (or, more accurately, determine the need for) a simple change like this.

So in Laminar, **ReactiveElement-s manage themselves**. A `ReactiveElement` encapsulates all the reactive updates that are happening inside. This means that you can add an element as a child without knowing how it's implemented or whether it's even static or dynamic. So a simple component could look like this:

```scala
// Define your "Component"
def colorfulSpan($color: XStream[String], caption: String): ReactiveElement[dom.html.Element] = {
  span(color <-- $color, caption)
}
 
// Now use it
val $prettyColor: XStream[String] = ???
val myDiv: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = div(
  "Hello ",
  colorfulSpan($prettyColor, "World")
)
```

This lets you to build loosely coupled applications very easily.

Having a stable reference to `myDiv` also simplifies your code significantly. If myDiv was a stream of divs instead, you'd need to engage in a potentially complex composition exercise to access the latest version of the element. Such useless complexity really adds up as your application grows, and avoiding needless complexity is one of Laminar's most important goals.


#### Available Receivers

TODO[Docs]: This section needs to be expanded. For now, just some examples:

```scala
input(focus <-- $isFocused) // either focuses or blurs the given element 
div(child <-- $childElement) // note: Every new element from the stream replaces the previous child emitted by this stream. All in all, works like you'd expect 
div(child.maybe <-- $elementOption)
div(child.text <-- $stringOption)
div(children <-- $childList) // Efficient diff-ing is performed to add / move / remove children to match the new list
div(children.command <-- $command) // command could be e.g. Append(element)
```

All these, especially the latter ones deserve much more explanation, which I will add eventually. For now please find the receivers in the source code, they do have some comments.

All of these receivers can co-exist on the same element, so something like this will work as expected:

```scala
div(
  color <-- $color,
  child <-- $firstChild,
  "Here's a list of items for you:",
  children <-- $items,
  "End of list! One more thing:",
  child <-- $goodbyeMessage
)
```

This will be very stable – it doesn't matter in what order the events on those streams will come, the children will always appear in the expected order. Under the hood this is achieved by creating invisible sentinel comment nodes for each child/children receiver to "reserve the spot" for future children coming in. This allows for great flexibility in writing your components with very little overhead.


#### Alternative Syntax for Receivers

TODO[Docs]: This section needs to be written.

For now, please see the various `<--` methods defined on `ReactiveElement`. This feature lets you write code like this:

```scala
myElement <-- color <-- $prettyColor
myElement <-- child <-- $child
myInput <-- focus <-- $isFocused
// (and so on)
```


### Event System: Emitters, Transformations, Buses 

#### Registering a DOM Event Listener

To start listening to DOM events, you need to register a listener for a specific event type (`EventProp`) on a specific DOM Element (`ReactiveElement`). `EventPropEmitter` is a `Modifier` that performs this action. 

This is how it's done in the simplest case:

```scala
val clickBus = new EventBus[dom.MouseEvent]
val $click: XStream[dom.MouseEvent] = clickBus.$ // resulting event stream that you can access any time  
val element: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div] = div(onClick --> clickBus, "Click me")
```

What this does line-by-line:

1. Create an `EventBus` – an object that accepts any kind of event, and forwards it to the stream that it exposes (see next line). EventBus simply encapsulates a an XStream `Producer` that fires events when its sendNext method is called. However, we hide both the producer and the sendNext method from you, the end user, to prevent mistakes if you decided to manually manage those. 

2. `$click` is simply the stream of events received (and therefore produced) by the `clickBus`. You can use it immediately after the event bus is created, no need to wait until the eventBus is attached to the element (see next line). You don't actually need this line for event registration to work. But you will want to read the events you capture at some point, and I'm just showing how that stream is exposed.

3. Last line creates a div element with a text node, and registers an event listener on it that listens to click events and forwards them to the clickBus. 
 
 `onClick --> clickBus` returns an `EventPropEmitter` which is a `Modifier`. Modifiers are applied to elements immediately after the element is created, and in the order in which they were defined on the element. An `EventPropEmitter` carries no element-specific state in its instance, so it can be reused on multiple elements if needed.
 
 Two conditions need to be met for `$click` to start firing events: 1) It needs to have at least one listener (standard for XStream streams), and 2) the `EventPropEmitter` that is built out of `clickBus` needs to be applied to some element.
 
 The implicit third condition is that the JS DOM actually produces click events on the div in question, so (without going into DOM event simulation) the div needs to be mounted and the user needs to click on it.
 
 Currently the event instances that you get in the output stream are native JS events. There are no magic synthetic events, no event pooling, nothing like that. There is one exception for certain `onClick` events on checkboxes, see "Special Cases" at the bottom of this document.

#### Alternative Event Listener Registration Syntax

Imagine you're building `TextInput`, a component that wraps an `input` element into a `div` with some styles added on top:

```scala
class TextInput private (
  val wrapperNode: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Div],
  val inputNode: ReactiveElement[dom.html.Input]
)
 
object TextInput {
  def apply(caption: String): TextInput = {
    val inputNode = input(typ := "text", color := "grey")
    val wrapperNode = div(caption, inputNode)
    new TextInput(wrapperNode, inputNode)
  }
}
```

This generic component does not necessarily know what events on `inputNode` the developer will care about when using it – `onKeyUp`, `onKeyPress`, `onChange`, `onInput`, others? There's just too many possibilities. And of course you wouldn't want to clutter your `TextInput`'s API by e.g. exposing all possibly useful event streams as vals on the `TextInput` class.

That's what `ReactiveElement.$event` method was made for:

```scala
val textInput = TextInput("Full name:")
val $changeEvent: XStream[dom.Event] = textInput.inputNode.$event(onChange)
```

Under the hood, `element.$event(eventProp)` creates an `eventBus`, applies an `eventProp --> eventBus` modifier to `element`, and returns `eventBus.$`. That's all there is to it, no magic – just alternative syntax that makes it easier to compose your components without tight coupling.

#### Multiple Event Listeners
 
Just like in native JS DOM, nothing is stopping you from registering two or more event listeners for the same event type on the same element:
 
 ```scala
div(onClick --> clickBus1, onClick --> clickBus2, "Click me")
``` 

In this case, two event listeners will be registered on the DOM node, one of them sending events to clickBus1, the other sending the exact same events to clickBus2. Of course, this works the same regardless of what syntax you use to register event listeners (see "Alternative Syntax" section above).

In most cases you could simply add another listener to `clickBus.$` to achieve whatever you needed multiple event listeners bound to the same element for – it's easier and more performant in extreme cases (thousands of nodes, I'd guess).

However, sometimes simpler composition is more important. For example, consider the `TextInput` component mentioned above. If the component itself had an internal need to listen to its own `onChange` events (e.g. for some built-in validation), that would be a case when adding a second `onChange` event listener to `inputNode` would make sense (the first one was added externally by end user of the component, as shown in the `TextInput` code snippet in the section above).

#### Event Transformations

Often times you don't really need a stream of e.g. click events – you know well in advance what each click event means, or which of the events you care about, etc. With the Alternative Syntax described above you would just use XStream operators to transform the stream of events, like this:

```scala
val incrementButton = button("+1")
val decrementButton = button("-1")
 
val $diff: XStream[Int] = XStream.merge(
  incrementButton.$event(onClick).mapTo(1), 
  decrementButton.$event(onClick).mapTo(-1) 
) // this stream emits +1 or -1
```

However, when using the standard `onClick --> eventBus` syntax, there is no stream that you could operate on before the events hit `eventBus`. Instead, we provide a different way to transform events:

First, you need to create an instance of `EventPropTransformation` by calling `apply` on your `EventProp` (via an implicit conversion to `EventPropOps`), e.g. `onClick`. Then you can call a bunch of transformation methods on the resulting object like `mapTo` or `filter` which would return new instances of `EventPropTransformation`. Lastly, you call the `-->` method as before. So the example above would translate into:

```scala
val diffBus = new EventBus[Int]
val incrementButton = button("+1", onClick.mapTo(1) --> diffBus)
val decrementButton = button("-1", onClick.mapTo(-1) --> diffBus)
val $diff: XStream[Int] = diffBus.$ // this stream emits +1 or -1
```

More syntax examples:

```scala
div("Click me", onClick.map(getClickCoordinates) --> clickCoordinatesBus)
 
div(onScroll().filter(throttle) --> filteredScrollEventBus)
 
div(onClick.config(useCapture = true) --> captureModeClickBus)
 
input(onKeyUp().filter(_.keyCode == KeyCode.Enter).preventDefault --> enterPressBus)
 
div(onClick.collect { case ev if ev.clientX > 100 => "yes" } --> yesStringBus)
 
// TODO[Docs] Come up with more relatable examples
```

`EventPropTransformation` instances are immutable and contain no element-specific state, so you can reuse them freely across multiple elements.

##### preventDefault & stopPropagation

These methods correspond to invocations of the corresponding native JS `dom.Event` methods. MDN docs: [preventDefault](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault), [stopPropagation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)

Importantly, these are just ordinarily transformations, and happen in the order in which you have chained them. For example, in the code snippet above `ev.preventDefault` will only be called on events that pass `filter(_.keyCode == KeyCode.Enter)`. Internally all transformations have access to both the latest processed value, and the original event, so it's fine to call the `.preventDefault` transformation even after you've used `.map(_.keyCode)` for example.

##### useCapture

JS DOM has two event modes: capture, and bubbling. Typically and by default we use the latter, but capture mode is sometimes useful for event listener priority/ordering (not specific to Laminar, standard JS DOM rules/limitations apply).

You need to specify whether to use capture mode the moment you register an event listener on the element, so it's passed as a parameter to `onClick.config(useCapture = true)` instead of being a method on `EventPropTransformation`.

See MDN [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) page for details ("useCapture" section).

##### Obtaining Typed Event Target

Due to dynamic nature of Javascript, `dom.Event.target` is typed only as `dom.EventTarget` for most events, which is not useful when you want to get `ev.target.value` from a target that is a `dom.html.Input` (but doesn't know it). So, you can't do this:

```scala
// Does not work because .value is defined on dom.html.Input, but not on dom.EventTarget :(
input(typ := "text", onChange().map(_.target.value) --> inputStringBus)
```

Easiest hackiest solution would be to use `.map(_.target.asInstanceOf[dom.html.Input].value)` but you should reconsider using Scala if you aren't cringing looking at this.

You could use our Alternative Syntax for registering events (see section above) for a somewhat safer solution:

```scala
val inputNode = input(typ := "text")
val $inputString = inputNode.$event(onChange).map(_ => inputNode.ref.value)
```

However, this is often cumbersome, and introduces the risk of referencing the wrong input node of the same type. We have a better way to get a properly typed target node, using a transformation:

```scala
input(onChange().mapToThisNode.map(_.ref.value) --> inputStringBus)
```

Or if you for example need to both filter events by .value and then grab the event.

```scala
input(onChange().mapToThisNode.filter(_.ref.value == "").mapToEvent --> filteredEventBus)
```

Lastly, if you need access to both the current node and the event, you can use the `.zipWithThisNode` method that gives you `(event, thisNode)` tuples.

Under the hood this works similar to `preventDefault` and `stopPropagation` (see above), relying on the transformation having access to both the original event and the processed value. And since all this eventually ends up as part of an `EventPropEmitter`, it also has access to the element to which we apply this `Modifier`.  

Note: "thisNode" in the method names refers to the element on which the event listener is **registered**. In JS DOM terms, this is `dom.Event.currentTarget`, not `dom.Event.target` – the latter refers to the node at which the event **originates**. When dealing with inputs these two targets are usually the same since inputs don't have any child elements, but you need to be aware of this conceptual difference for other events. MDN docs: [target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target), [currentTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget).

You might have noticed that some `EventProp`s like `onClick` promise somewhat peculiar event types like `TypedTargetMouseEvent` instead of the expected `MouseEvent` – these refined types come from _Scala DOM Types_, and merely provide more specific types for `.target` (as much as is reasonably possible). These types are optional – if you don't care about `.target`, you can just treat such events as simple `MouseEvent`s because `TypedTargetMouseEvent` do in fact extend `MouseEvent`.

#### Reusing an Event Bus
 
What if you want to render a few elements, and combine all of their `onClick` events into a single event bus? Just add a `onClick --> clickBus` modifier to all of them in whatever way is most convenient.
 
 The event bus itself is not tied to any element by any means, the `-->` method simply provides a way for an element to pass events to an event bus. If multiple elements are doing that, well, then your event bus is receiving events from all those elements.

#### MergeBus

`EventBus` is great when your event source comes directly from Laminar's own `EvenPropEmitter`, as shown above. But this Subject/Proxy-like concept has one more useful application, for which we have a special subclass: `MergeBus`. 

`XStream.merge(stream2, stream2, ...)` can merge a fixed set of streams into one stream that re-emits all of the events that are fired on each of the input streams. This is useful for simple cases when you know which streams you need to merge in advance, like in the code snippet with increment/decrement buttons in the "Event Transformations" section above.

`MergeBus` acts very much like `XStream.merge`, except it lets you add and remove source streams dynamically. This is invaluable to avoid complicated and often inefficient data structures like streams-of-lists-of-streams when dealing with changing lists of things.

For example, if you're rendering a list of child components each of which exposes a stream of events, and you want to get a stream that merges all those streams into one stream, you would create a `MergeBus` in the parent component, and whenever you create an instance of a child component you call `childNode.subscribeBus(childStream, mergeBus)`. What this does is calls `mergeBus.addSource(childStream)` under the hood, making sure to call `mergeBus.removeSource(childStream)` when `childNode` is discarded.

That way as you create and destroy child components, your `mergeBus` continues to receive events from only the currently relevant (in this case, mounted) child components, discarding unused streams with no memory leaks.

Note that `MergeBus` behaves more like a complex operator than an XStream `Listener` in terms of laziness and memory management. Under the hood it adds a listener to every source stream if/when its output stream (.$) acquires its first listener, and removes the listener from every source stream when its output stream loses its last listener. So if the output stream has no listeners, the input streams will not get a listener either.

When passing down a `MergeBus` to child components, you're exposing its output stream to the children, which is usually undesired because you don't want to give child components access to read all the events sent into `MergeBus` by other child components, you only want to give them write access into that bus. It is recommended to upcast your `MergeBus` to `WriteMergeBus` (e.g. using `MergeBus.asWriteBus`). `WriteMergeBus` does not expose an output stream.

TODO[Docs]: Too many words. Provide or link to concrete examples that I developed.

##### MergeBus Transformations

To reduce boilerplate and simplify composition, we provide a few methods that let you create new `MergeBus`-es from an existing `MergeBus`. For example:

```scala
val requestBus = new MergeBus[AJAXRequest]
val modelDiffToRequest: ModelDiff => AJAXRequest
val modelDiffBus: MergeBus[ModelDiff] = requestBus.map(modelDiffToRequest)
```

Now, all events that are outputted by `modelDiffBus.$` will be forwarded into `requestBus` after being processed by `modelDiffToRequest`, so you can pass `modelDiffBus` down to a child component that knows how to output model diffs into a bus, but doesn't / shouldn't know how to convert them into AJAX requests.

There's also a `compose` method for more complicated transformations. We might add `filter` and `collect` in the future.


### Stream Memory Management

Streams are not garbage collected as long as they have listeners. So, if you call `myStream.addListener` or `myStream.subscribe`, you need to also call `myStream.removeListener` or `myStream.unsubscribe` respectively when you are done using `myStream` and would like it to be garbage collected (normal JS GC rules apply as well, of course).

Some subscriptions you might want to exist for the whole lifetime of your app, so you don't need to do anything about them, but most of the subscriptions in your app at some point should be discarded.

For example, when Laminar subscribes to a stream internally, e.g. via `color <-- myColorStream` or `myNode <-- color <-- myColorStream`, that subscription should only exist for as long as the relevant DOM node is used. Once the node is discarded, we can also discard the subscription. Laminar handles this automatically (read more on this below).

However, you're responsible for cleaning up subscriptions that you create manually. Currently you can manually tie the lifecycle of a subscription to the lifecycle of a particular element using `ReactiveElement.subscribe` or `ReactiveElement.subscribeBus`. Future versions of Laminar will provide a way to tie subscriptions to a lifecycle context automatically.


### Element Lifecycle Events

Laminar nodes that are elements expose streams of lifecycle events that can be useful for integrating third party DOM libraries and other tasks. This events are similar in spirit to React.js lifecycle hooks like `componentDidMount` or `componentWillUnmount`, but are implemented very differently.

All lifecycle events are fired synchronously, with no async delay.

#### Parent Change Events

**`$parentChange: XStream[ParentChangeEvent]`**

This stream fires any time when this element's direct parent changes. Actually, two events are fired at that time: immediately before the change is applied to both the real DOM and Laminar's DOM tree, and immediately after that. In addition to the `alreadyChanged` flag, these events carry references to `maybePrevParent` and `maybeNextParent`, letting you know exactly what happened.

This stream only fires when direct parent of this element is changed. It does not track changes in the parent's parent and higher up ancestors. This stream fires regardless of whether this element is mounted or not (see definition below).

#### Mount Events

An element is considered mounted if it is present in the DOM, i.e. if its real DOM node is a descendant of `org.scalajs.dom.document`. All elements that are not mounted are considered unmounted.

Laminar has three kinds of mount events:

**`NodeDidMount`** – fired when the element **becomes mounted ** (i.e. it was previously unmounted). Specifically, this happens immediately after the corresponding parent change event with `alreadyChanged=true` (see above) is fired. At this point, the element is **already** present in the DOM.

 When an element is mounted, its subscriptions are activated. That means that emitters like `onClick --> myClickBus` and `element.$events(onClick)` will actually start listening for and relay DOM events to your listeners, and receivers like `href <-- $url` will start listening for your streams. To further clarify: when you create the element the desired subscriptions are only created and recorded in `ReactiveElement.subscriptions`. They only start working once you mount your element into the DOM. 

**`NodeWillUnmount`** – fired when the element **becomes unmounted** (i.e. it was previously mounted). Specifically, this happens immediately after the corresponding parent change event with `alreadyChanged=false` (see above) is fired. At this point, the element is **still** present in the DOM, but will be removed from the DOM immediately after this event.

When an element is unmounted, its subscriptions are deactivated. That is, emitters stop listening for and relaying events, and receivers unsubscribe from input streams and stop updating the element's node. This means that the element will miss all events that happened while it is unmounted, so if you were to mount it after sending some events to it, the state of its DOM node could be stale.

If you want to temporarily "remove" the element from the DOM, but still keep its subscriptions active, you should hide it using CSS `display: none` instead of unmounting it. 

When an element is unmounted, one subscription, `ReactiveElement.mountEventSubscription`, remains active – it listens for mount events, ready to re-activate all the other subscriptions if this element gets re-mounted. However, we don't want this subscription to exist indefinitely, otherwise we would leak memory every time an element is unmounted never to be used again, which brings us to the last type of mount events:

**`NodeWillBeDiscarded`** – fired when the end user has indicated that they will not mount this element ever again. Currently, this is always fired right after the `NodeWillUnmount` event, so currently unmounting an element means that you can't re-mount it again (its subscriptions will not re-activate). Future versions of Laminar will include a way for end users to specify that they intend to re-mount a given element after unmounting it.

#### Order of Lifecycle Events

For extra clarity, lifecycle events triggered by the same underlying parent change event are fired in the following order:

1) `ParentChangeEvent(alreadyChanged=false, maybePrevParent, maybeNextParent)`,
2) `NodeWillUnmount` (if we're unmounting),
3) `NodeWillBeDiscarded` (if we're unmounting),
4) `ParentChangeEvent(alreadyChanged=true, maybePrevParent, maybeNextParent)`,
5) `NodeDidMount` (if mounting)

#### Mount Event Streams

So how do you actually listen for mount events? Laminar exposes the following streams on each `ReactiveElement`:

**`$mountEvent`** – fires a full stream of mount events that affect this node. If the node was mounted or will be unmounted, directly or indirectly, this event will be here. This stream is a simple merge of the two mutually exclusive streams below: 

**`$thisNodeMountEvent`** – fires mount events that were caused by this element changing its parent only. Does not include mount events triggered by changes higher in the hierarchy (grandparent and up).

**`$thisNodeMountEvent`** – fires mount events that were caused by changes in this element's grandparent or any of its parents. Does not include mount events triggered by changes in this elements's parent.

#### Lifecycle Events Performance

Maintaining multiple lifecycle event streams for every single element in the DOM would be needlessly costly, especially given that `$mountEvent` is recursive – a child's `$mountEvent` stream is in part derived from all of its ancestors' `$mountEvent` streams. Laminar has a few optimizations to make this efficient. Here is how it works:

1) All streams are defined as `lazy val`-s, and are not even initialized until you access them. Then when you do, only the required dependencies of those streams are initialized. So when you ask for a `$mountEvent` stream of one element, only then will Laminar initialize `$mountEvent` streams of this child's parents, if they weren't initialized already. 

2) Until the streams are initialized, the underlying event buses don't even receive events. `$parentChange` gets its events from the event bus stored inside `maybeParentChangeBus`, but that `Option` remains `None` until `$parentChange` is accessed. Similarly with `$thisNodeMountEvent` and `maybeThisNodeMountEventBus`. All other lifecycle streams are derived from these two streams using simple transformations.

3) We avoid redundant computations as much as possible. All XStream streams are multicast (shared execution), which works well for this case because elements high up in the DOM hierarchy will typically have many listeners on their `$mountEvent` streams. Also, some of the most expensive calculations like determining whether an element is mounted or not are performed only once per original `ParentChangeEvent` – the same event instance is reused downstream with no additional allocations or DOM access required.

Importantly, you don't need to be accessing `$mountEvent` directly in order to trigger initialization of all the lazy streams. Every element that has any subscriptions (either listens to streams or emits events) will be listening to `$mountEvent` already.

There's more to this system, but for now this will have to do as an MVP summary. All in all, this system should work quite well, and if you run into performance problems on huge DOM trees with many subscriptions, this should give you some understanding of which bottleneck you could be hitting, and how to work around it. 

One way to simplify your code that is Laminar-specific is to use `ReactiveElement.isMounted` method instead of subscribing to `$mountEvent`. It is provided mostly as an escape hatch for third party integrations that do not map  well to FRP design patterns, but using it could also potentially improve performance over using `$mountEvent` (but again, don't worry about it if you're not actually hitting a performance problem). 

### Special Cases

Laminar is conceptually a simple layer adding a reactive streaming API to Scala DOM Builder. In general there is no magic to it, what goes in goes out, transformed in some obvious way. However, in a few cases we do some ugly things under the hood so that you don't need to pull your hair and still do said ugly things in your own code.

Please let me know via github issues if any of this magic caused you grief. It's supposed to be almost universally helpful.

##### 1. checkbox.onClick + event.preventDefault() = async event stream

All event streams in Laminar emit events synchronously – as soon as they happen – **except** if the stream in question is a stream of `onClick` events on an `input(typ := "checkbox")` element, and you generated wthis stream using `preventDefault = true` option in Laminar's API.

Such streams fire events after a `setTimeout(0)` instead of firing immediately after the browser triggers the event. Without this hack/magic, you would have been unable to update the `checked` property of this checkbox from a stream that is (synchronously) derived from the given stream of `onClick` events, and this is a common practice when building controlled components.

The underlying issue is described in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32710212/2601788).

**Escape hatch:** instead of using Laminar's `preventDefault` option/method, call `ev.preventDefault()` manually _after_ the event was passed to the event bus.

**Watch out:** If you are reading the `checked` property of the checkbox in an affected stream, it will contain the original, unchanged value. This behaviour could be surprising  if you don't know about this stream being async, but do know about the native DOM behaviour of temporarily updating this value and then resetting it back. This is deemed a smaller problem than the original issue because it's easier to debug, and better matches the commonly-expected semantics of `preventDefault`.


### FAQ

#### Why XStream.js instead of Monix / Scala.rx / etc.?

I chose XStream.s because it was designed specifically for Cycle.js, a use case very similar to Laminar. XStream's main strengths are: 

* Conceptually simple. XStream streams are synchronous, "hot" / multicast (executed only once per event, not once per event per listener). There are no schedulers, execution contexts, backpressure strategies / etc because those are irrelevant in Javascript. It is very beginner-friendly.

* Small download size. XStream is less than 40KB in production. For comparison, as far as I can tell Monix is around 200KB, which is significantly more. Not just because of the download latency, but because all that code needs to be unzipped, parsed and loaded into memory. Especially on mobile devices that's a big problem.

That said, XStream is not perfect in a number of ways, and we are looking for a better solution. See [issue #5](https://github.com/raquo/laminar/issues/5) for ongoing discussion.
