## Airstream Bug Fixes

Laminar 17.2.1 release consists entirely of two Airstream bug fixes. The fix slightly changes Airstream behaviour, although you are unlikely to be relying on the current incorrect behaviour.


### Fixed: flattenSwitch / flatMapSwitch unwanted restart issue

When `flattenSwitch` (or `flatMapSwitch`) operator switches from `signal1` to `signal2`, it first disconnects from `signal1` before connecting to `signal2`. Usually this is the right thing to do.

Our code already had a special case – we don't do this if `signal1 == signal2` – in that case we don't need to restart the same signal for no reason, so we just keep it active, without power-cycling it.

However, there is a more advanced variation of this special case that we failed to consider previously – if both `signal1` and `signal2` have a common ancestor `signal0`, and `signal0` has no other observers, switching from `signal1` to `signal2` will cause `signal0` to briefly stop and then re-start.

This is undesirable because some signals may have custom onStart logic in them – for example, `EventStream.fromValue(1).toSignal(0)` will emit `1` every time it's started (by design), so we don't want to re-start such a signal when the user does not explicit mean to, as it would produce an unexpected event – a glitch.

The 17.2.1 release fixes this with a make-before-break mechanism – now, when `flattenSwitch` switches from `signal1` to `signal2`, it first connects to the new `signal2` source before disconnecting from the old `signal1` source. This ensures that any common ancestors of the old and new signals remain active and are not re-started unnecessarily.

All of this applies to streams just as well as signals.

**Migration:** You may have `flattenSwitch` / `flatMapSwitch` signals (or streams) that currently emit extra events due to this bug, and they will stop emitting those events. I believe those glitchy events are entirely undesirable, so if everything is working fine for you right now, chances are it will continue working fine, but if you have experienced weird / unexplained events when flattening observables, this may just fix it.


### Fixed: split signal's child looking at inactive split signal

`SplitChildSignal` (the signal that the `split` operator's callback gives you for each item) reads the internal state of `SplitSignal` (the result of the `.split` operator itself) to do its thing, but does not formally depend on it as an observable.

This means that if `SplitChildSignal` has observers, and `SplitSignal` does not, then `SplitSignal` is not running and so it is not updating its internal state. IN this scenario, `SplitChildSignal` can potentially read stale/incorrect state from `SplitSignal`, resulting in `SplitSignal` emitting a stale/incorrect version of its item, or failing to emit when it's due.

We fixed this by properly emulating `SplitChildSignal`'s dependency on `SplitSignal`. Our `SplitChildSignal` is perhaps the weirdest signal in Airstream on a technical/implementation level, so it needed special care for this.

**Migration:** In practice, you are unlikely to encounter this bug when using typical Laminar patterns. And if you did, you would likely notice `SplitChildSignal` emitting incorrect values.

Artūras Šlajus has provided a [great example](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/issues/140) of these two bugs working together to sabotage two nested `split`-s followed by a `map` and a `flattenSwitch`.
